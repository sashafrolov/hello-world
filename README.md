# Hello-World
## Repository for Beginning an Illustrious Career on Github

So I was supposed to be learning how to use Bootstrap, but this Markdown stuff is kinda interesting. It works like BBS code, except the hard coded version of it is even more reasonable. All of the marky stuff is really intuitive, and it works like you think it would.

One exception to this is the stupid Reddit style links with the brackets and whatnot, but Github Flavored Markdown has fixed that. On the other hand, Github's stuff related to code highlighting kind of detracts from this.

> This is fairly easy, if I may say so myself
